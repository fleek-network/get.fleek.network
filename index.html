# "Get Fleek Network" is an attempt to make our software more accessible.
# By providing scripts to automate the installation process of our software,
# we believe that it can help improve the onboarding experience of our users.
#
# Quick install: `curl https://get.fleek.network | bash`
#
# This script automates the process illustrated in our install documentation and guides,
# advanced users might find it better to follow the instructions in the documentation site.
# If that's your preference, go ahead and check our guides https://docs.fleek.network

# Contributing?
# - If you'd like to test changes locally based on a Lightning repo branch use the env var `USE_LIGHTNING_BRANCH`
# - If you'd like to test changes locally based on a get.fleek.network repo branch use the env var `USE_GET_BRANCH`
# E.g. curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fleek-network/get.fleek.network/feat/foobar-foo-bar/install | USE_GET_BRANCH="feat/foobar-foo-bar" bash
