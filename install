# "Get Fleek Network" is an attempt to make our software more accessible.
# By providing scripts to automate the installation process of our software,
# we believe that it can help improve the onboarding experience of our users.
#
# Quick install: `curl https://get.fleek.network | bash`
#
# This script automates the process illustrated in our guide "Running a Node in a Docker container"
# and "how to install rust and the dependencies for ursa cli"
# advanced users might find it better to follow the instructions in the guide
# If that's your preference, go ahead and check our guides https://docs.fleek.network
